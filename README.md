# Description

I drew a little design idea on a piece of paper and jumped to the HTML and CSS build. I skipped doing a prototype because I did not have any idea about the end result because of me not having any experience with JS before starting this semester.
From having no experience to some idea of how it works I am actually very happy with my result.
It is simple but it works which I hope is the whole idea for this CA.

## Built with

- HTML
